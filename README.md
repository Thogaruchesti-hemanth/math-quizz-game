# 📱 Math Quiz App (Android - Java)

A fun and educational Android app that challenges users with randomly generated **addition problems**, offers **four multiple-choice answers**, tracks their **score**, and runs against a **countdown timer**. Built using **Java** and **Android Studio** as part of my journey in learning Android development.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. App launches with a **Start** button.
2. A random **addition problem** is shown (e.g., 5 + 3).
3. Four possible answers are displayed (one correct, three random).
4. The user taps the answer.
5. If correct, the **score** increases.
6. A **30-second timer** runs — user must solve as many as possible.
7. At the end, the total score is displayed.
